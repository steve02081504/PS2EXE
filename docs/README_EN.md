## Install

```powershell
Install-Module ps12exe #Install ps12exe module
Set-ps12exeContextMenu #Set right-click menu
```

(you can also clone this repository and run `./ps12exe.ps1` directly)

**Hard to upgrade from PS2EXE to ps12exe? No problem!**  
PS2EXE2ps12exe can hooks PS2EXE calls into ps12exe, All you need is just uninstall PS2EXE and install this, then use PS2EXE as normal.

```powershell
Uninstall-Module PS2EXE
Install-Module PS2EXE2ps12exe
```

## Usage

### Right-click menu

Once you have set `Set-ps12exeContextMenu`, you can quickly compile any ps1 file into an exe or open ps12exeGUI on this file by right-clicking on it.

### GUI mode

```powershell
ps12exeGUI
```

### Console mode

```powershell
ps12exe .\source.ps1 .\target.exe
```

compiles `source.ps1` into the executable target.exe (if `.\target.exe` is omitted, output is written to `.\source.exe`).

```powershell
'"Hello World!"' | ps12exe
```

compiles `"Hello World!"` into the executable `.\a.exe`.

```powershell
ps12exe https://raw.githubusercontent.com/steve02081504/ps12exe/master/src/GUI/Main.ps1
```

compiles `Main.ps1` from the internet into the executable `.\Main.exe`.

### Self-Host WebServer

```powershell
Start-ps12exeWebServer
```

Starts a web server that can be used to compile powerShell scripts online.

## Remarks

### Prepossessing

ps12exe preprocesses the script before compiling.  

```powershell
# Read the program frame from the ps12exe.cs file
#_if PSEXE #This is the preprocessing code used when the script is compiled by ps12exe
	#_include_as_value programFrame "$PSScriptRoot/ps12exe.cs" #Inline the contents of ps12exe.cs into this script
#_else #Otherwise read the cs file normally
	[string]$programFrame = Get-Content $PSScriptRoot/ps12exe.cs -Raw -Encoding UTF8
#_endif
```

#### `#_if <condition>`/`#_else`/`#_endif`

```powershell
$LocalizeData =
	#_if PSScript
		. $PSScriptRoot\src\LocaleLoader.ps1
	#_else
		#_include "$PSScriptRoot/src/locale/en-UK.psd1"
	#_endif
```

Only the following conditions are now supported: `PSEXE` and `PSScript`.  
`PSEXE` is true , `PSScript` is false.  

#### `#_include <filename|url>`/`#_include_as_value <valuename> <file|url>`

```powershell
#_include <filename|url>
#_include_as_value <valuename> <file|url>
```

Includes the content of the file `<filename|url>` or `<file|url>` into the script. The content of the file is inserted at the position of the `#_include`/`#_include_as_value` command.  

Unlike the `#_if` statement, if you don't enclose the filename in quotes, the `#_include` family treats the trailing space & `#` as part of the filename as well.  

```powershell
#_include $PSScriptRoot/super #weird filename.ps1
#_include "$PSScriptRoot/filename.ps1" #safe comment!
```

The content of the file is preprocessed when `#_include` is used, which allows you to include files at multiple levels.  

`#_include_as_value` inserts the content of the file as a string value into the script. The content of the file is not preprocessed.  

In most cases you don't need to use the `#_if` and `#_include` preprocessing commands to make the scripts include sub-scripts correctly after conversion to exe. ps12exe automatically handles cases like the following and assumes that the target script should be included:

```powershell
. $PSScriptRoot/another.ps1
& $PSScriptRoot/another.ps1
$result = & "$PSScriptRoot/another.ps1" -args
```

#### `#_include_as_(base64|bytes) <valuename> <file|url>`

```powershell
#_include_as_base64 <valuename> <file|url>
#_include_as_bytes <valuename> <file|url>
```

Includes the content of a file as a base64 string or byte array at preprocessing time. The file content itself is not preprocessed.

Here's a simple packer example:

```powershell
#_include_as_bytes mydata $PSScriptRoot/data.bin
[System.IO.File]::WriteAllBytes("data.bin", $mydata)
```

This EXE will, upon execution, extract the `data.bin` file embedded in the script during compilation.

#### `#_!!`

```powershell
$Script:eshDir =
#_if PSScript #It is not possible to have $EshellUI in PSEXE and $PSScriptRoot is not valid!
if (Test-Path "$($EshellUI.Sources.Path)/path/esh") { $EshellUI.Sources.Path }
elseif (Test-Path $PSScriptRoot/../path/esh) { "$PSScriptRoot/.." }
elseif
#_else
	#_!!if
#_endif
(Test-Path $env:LOCALAPPDATA/esh) { "$env:LOCALAPPDATA/esh" }
```

Any line beginning with `#_!!` line that `#_!!` will be removed.

#### `#_require <modulesList>`

```powershell
#_require ps12exe
#_pragma Console 0
$Number = [bigint]::Parse('0')
$NextNumber = $Number+1
$NextScript = $PSEXEscript.Replace("Parse('$Number')", "Parse('$NextNumber')")
$NextScript | ps12exe -outputFile $PSScriptRoot/$NextNumber.exe *> $null
$Number
```

`#_require` count the modules needed in the entire script and add the script equivalent of the following code before the first `#_require`:

```powershell
$modules | ForEach-Object{
	if(!(Get-Module $_ -ListAvailable -ea SilentlyContinue)) {
		Install-Module $_ -Scope CurrentUser -Force -ea Stop
	}
}
```

It is worth noting that the code it generates will only install modules, not import them.
Please use `Import-Module` as appropriate.

When you need to require more than one module, you can use spaces, commas, or semicolons and periods as separators instead of writing multi-line require statements.

```powershell
#_require module1 module2;module3、module4,module5
```

#### `#_pragma`

The pragma preprocessor directive has no effect on the content of the script, but modifies the parameters used for compilation.  
The following is an example:

```powershell
PS C:\Users\steve02081504> '12' | ps12exe
Compiled file written -> 1024 bytes
PS C:\Users\steve02081504> ./a.exe
12
PS C:\Users\steve02081504> '#_pragma Console no
>> 12' | ps12exe
Preprocessed script -> 23 bytes
Compiled file written -> 2560 bytes
```

As you can see, `#_pragma Console no` makes the generated exe file run in windowed mode, even if we didn't specify `-noConsole` at compile time.
The pragma command can set any compilation parameter:

```powershell
#_pragma noConsole #windowed
#_pragma Console #console
#_pragma Console no #windowed
#_pragma Console true #console
#_pragma icon $PSScriptRoot/icon.ico #set icon
#_pragma title "title" #set title
```

#### `#_balus`

```powershell
#_balus <exitcode>
#_balus
```

When the code reaches this point, the process exits with the given exit code and deletes the EXE file.

### Minifyer

Since ps12exe's "compilation" embeds everything in the script verbatim as a resource in the resulting executable, the resulting executable will be large if the script has a lot of useless strings.  
You can specify a script block with the `-Minifyer` parameter that will process the script after preprocessing before compilation to achieve a smaller generated executable.  

If you don't know how to write such a script block, you can use [psminnifyer](https://github.com/steve02081504/psminnifyer).

```powershell
& ./ps12exe.ps1 ./main.ps1 -NoConsole -Minifyer { $_ | &./psminnifyer.ps1 }
```

### List of cmdlets not implemented

The basic input/output commands had to be rewritten in C# for ps12exe. Not implemented are *`Write-Progress`* in console mode (too much work) and *`Start-Transcript`*/*`Stop-Transcript`* (no proper reference implementation by Microsoft).

### GUI mode output formatting

Per default in powershell outputs of commandlets are formatted line per line (as an array of strings). When your command generates 10 lines of output and you use GUI output, 10 message boxes will appear each awaiting for an OK. To prevent this pipe your commandto the comandlet `Out-String`. This will convert the output to one string array with 10 lines, all output will be shown in one message box (for example: `dir C:\ | Out-String`).

### Config files

ps12exe can create config files with the name of the `generated executable + ".config"`. In most cases those config files are not necessary, they are a manifest that tells which .Net Framework version should be used. As you will usually use the actual .Net Framework, try running your excutable without the config file.

### Parameter processing

Compiled scripts process parameters like the original script does. One restriction comes from the Windows environment: for all executables all parameters have the type String, if there is no implicit conversion for your parameter type you have to convert explicitly in your script. You can even pipe content to the executable with the same restriction (all piped values have the type String).

### Password security

Never store passwords in your compiled script!  
The entire script is easily visible to any .net decompiler.

### Distinguish environment by script  

You can tell whether a script is running in a compiled exe or in a script by `$Host.Name`.  

```powershell
if ($Host.Name -eq "PSEXE") { Write-Output "ps12exe" } else { Write-Output "Some other host" }
```

### Script variables

Since ps12exe converts a script to an executable, the variable `$MyInvocation` is set to other values than in a script.

You still can use `$PSScriptRoot` to retrieve the directory path where the executable is located, and new `$PSEXEpath` to obtain the path of the executable itself.

### Window in background in -noConsole mode

When an external window is opened in a script with `-noConsole` mode (i.e. for `Get-Credential` or for a command that needs a `cmd.exe` shell) the next window is opened in the background.

The reason for this is that on closing the external window windows tries to activate the parent window. Since the compiled script has no window, the parent window of the compiled script is activated instead, normally the window of Explorer or Powershell.

To work around this, `$Host.UI.RawUI.FlushInputBuffer()` opens an invisible window that can be activated. The following call of `$Host.UI.RawUI.FlushInputBuffer()` closes this window (and so on).

The following example will not open a window in the background anymore as a single call of `ipconfig | Out-String` will do:

```powershell
$Host.UI.RawUI.FlushInputBuffer()
ipconfig | Out-String
$Host.UI.RawUI.FlushInputBuffer()
```
